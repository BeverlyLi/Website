		<h1>Project Road Rage Case Study</h1><br/>
		
		<h2>
		November 2017 - June 2019
		</h2><br/>
		
		<h2>Background</h2>
		<p>
		Project Road Rage is a game that simulates driving in a busy city. 
		Players will encounter obstacles as they drive around the street in our 
		VR city environment, and they can respond by avoiding, honking, or 
		crashing into things to earn points within a time limit. The user can 
		turn the steering wheel left and right and step on the brake, just like 
		in a real car. The game is designed to be loud, fun, and stress-relieving
		by simulating what would happen if you let your anger out on the street.
		</p><br/>
		
		<h2>Project Overview</h2>
		<p> 
		This project was developed over 2 years in a team of 5, with new team 
		members being swapped in the second year. Once a week, we would hold a 
		team meeting to discuss new ideas, work together to implement cool 
		features, and have fun testing our code in a virtual universe. We chose 
		to do this project because as young adults who were familiar with the 
		road, we were inspired by our daily struggle with traffic and the 
		frustration we felt while driving. Thus, the game allows players to 
		channel those frustrations into a game where the more annoyed they get, 
		the more points they want to achieve. Twice a year, we had showcases that
		allowed other UCSD students to experience blissful road rage.
		</p>

			<u>Role:</u> During the first year of the project, I learned how to 
			use Blender to create an intricate 3D car that we could import into 
			Unity as well as how to program in C# to make the car turn and go 
			forward. In the second year, I became co-lead of the project and 
			continued to program and debug the steering and movement of the car 
			while offering advice and guidance to new members.

		<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
		<p class="center">
		Frustrated drivers need a way to relieve their stress and anger on the 
		road without having to deal with real life consequences.
		</p><br/>
		
		<h2>Needfinding</h2>
		<p>
		For a driver, sometimes being on the road is frustrating when there is 
		too much traffic or when someone else cuts you off. Because of this, we 
		found that there was a need to release driving-related anger without 
		causing damage to other objects or people. When I asked other people what 
		they usually did when driving in these situations, they responded that 
		they turned on the radio, honked at the driver, or tried to calm down by
		letting it go. However, these tactics may not be the most effective, so 
		we tried to implement a game that would alleviate some of their anger for
		when they tried driving again in the future. In addition, for those who
		are learning how to drive but didn't have a car or a driving instructor,
		Road Rage could be an opportunity that allows users to get a feel for the
		driving basics. We recreate the feel of a real car by having users sit 
		down, place their foot on our cardboard foot pedal, and grab on to the 
		virtual steering wheel. 
		</p><br/>
		
		<h2>Brainstorming and Game Plan</h2>
		<p>
		We spent the first few weeks as a team planning out what we wanted to 
		include in our game, how we were going to implement certain features, 
		what tools we needed, and different tasks that needed to be done. This 
		included what type of objects the player could hit, what our project set
		out to accomplish, motivations, and driving improvements that could be 
		made. Each person was responsible for coming to team meetings, 
		contributing their thoughts, and learning how to use Unity or Blender.
		After learning how to use our tools, our general flow was to have a
		possible feature, code that feature, debug it, and make sure it worked
		before moving on to the next thing. Our most important task was to ensure
		that the driving was smooth and did not cause the player to be nauseous.
		After the main functionality was completed, we could worry about other 
		things such as sound effects, adding more color, and creating more 
		objects to crash into. The pictures below show a more detailed account
		of our collective brainstorming.

		<h2>Low Fidelity Prototype</h2>
		<p>
		For our initial prototype, our main goal was to use our understanding of
		Unity and Blender to create a basic working car in a simple environment.
		The buildings were models that were imported from the assets store in 
		Unity and the spheres we ran into were default objects, but the car and 
		wheel I modeled myself in Blender. In order to make the car steer, we 
		used the track pads on the HTC Vive Controllers to sense the position of 
		our thumb. Wherever the thumb was on the trackpad, the car's tires would 
		face the direction of the thumb. With a bit of physics and math, we made
		the car accelerate by pressing and holding the trigger button on the back
		of the controller. To make the car stop completely, the user would have 
		to press a button on the side of the controller, which would rapidly 
		decelerate the car. We also added a speedometer  to the right of the 
		wheel so the player could see how fast they were going. As of this point,
		the player could go backwards and forwards, turn the car and brake, and 
		drive around the city while crashing into spheres.

		<h2>User Testing and Research</h2>
		<p>
		During our showcases with our polished prototype, we had students from
		UCSD try out our game and give us feedback on their driving experience. 
		Before each demo, we had to verbally explain what the controls were so
		they could correctly move where they wanted to go. Their task was to go 
		through a city maze and find the exit, which required great control over 
		the mobility of the car. In later showcases, players could also crash 
		into objects to score points. However, we noticed that many users would
		have to be told the controls multiple times in order to progress through
		the maze. Specifically, some users spent a lot of time figuring out how
		to go backwards after crashing into a building because they had to think
		about which button mapped to what function. Others said that they were
		quite nauseous after playing the game and said the steering was not
		steady enough or too sensitive with the thumb input. From these comments,
		we knew we had to change how players could control the car. In general,
		our users struggled to remember which buttons did what, which made the
		game less fun than it could have been. The nausea was also caused by a
		disconnect between button presses and what they expected to happen.
		There were too many buttons on the controller to keep track of and we 
		wanted to make the experience more realistic. Our next iteration would 
		use less buttons and have players intuitively grab onto a wheel to steer 
		instead.

		<h2>Alternate Designs</h2>
		<p>
		Our previous research had shown that our controls were too confusing and 
		needed to be changed. After another brainstorming session, we decided to
		move the steering function onto the virtual steering wheel and added a 
		foot pedal that players could physically step on to accelerate the car 
		using Nintendo joycons. The only button that needed to be pressed was the
		trigger button and the trackpad, which made it much more simple to play.
		In order to detect if the steering wheel was grabbed, we had to check 
		that the virtual controller was colliding with the virtual wheel and that 
		the trigger button was pressed. Holding down the trigger button while 
		colliding with the wheel allowed the user to move the wheel left and 
		right to turn the tires of the car. To go forward, the player would step 
		on the foot pedal which would cause a change in the position of the
		joycons and signal an increase in acceleration. To imitate switching 
		gears in a real car, if the player wanted to change between going 
		forwards and backwards, they would press above and below the center of 
		the trackpad, respectively. Our alternate design showed much improvement 
		in later showcases and less users reported being nauseous. Moreover, 
		they were feeling much better about the steering now that they had a
		wheel to grab onto.

		<p>
		Our final showcase included an improved car model and wheel, a
		proper race track with objects to crash into, and a friendly passenger 
		that reacted to crashes. With smoother steering, players were motivated 
		to crash into everything they could and we could see the smile on their
		face when they did. Our team worked hard for 2 years on this project, 
		but we also had a blast testing our game and sharing it with other people.
