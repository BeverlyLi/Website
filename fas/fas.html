		<h1>Find and Seek Case Study</h1><br/>
		
		<h2>
		January 2020 - March 2020
		</h2><br/>
		
		<h2>Background</h2>
		<p>
			It's easy to misplace objects when you're a busy college student 
			on the go. You have a million things to worry about, but where you left 
			your hydroflask should not be one of them. You try to share about it on 
			Facebook and Reddit, but your unpopular post is easily lost in a sea of 
			pages and threads. Wouldn't it be more efficient to have a centralized 
			app for all things lost and found where you can filter and search for 
			what you need?
		</p><br/>
		
		<h2>Project Overview</h2>
		<p>
			Developed in 10 weeks in a team of 3, Find and Seek is a lost and 
			found mobile web app catered to UCSD students to help them find items
			they've lost. Each week, we learned various aspects of design, web 
			development, and user testing to ultimately create a polished minimum 
			viable product.  
		</p>
		
		<p class="role">
			<u>Role:</u> As a programmer, my primary focus was on learning how
			to use Javascript with Node.js. I designed page layouts, managed data 
			in JSON files, set up links and skeleton code for pages, and worked 
			on the posting function, button presses, and overall aesthetic. 
		</p>
		
		<p>Languages/Tools: HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node.js</p>

		<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
		<p>
			UCSD students can help others find something they lost in a cheap, 
			convenient, and time-efficient way without having to go on multiple 
			platforms.
		</p><br/>
		
		<h2>Storyboarding</h2>
		<p>
			We thought about what users felt when they lost something and how they
			could use our app to solve their problem using storyboards. 
			Implementation-wise, we could solve the problem in different ways. 
			These storyboards serve as a hypothetical as to how effective our 
			solution can be.
		</p>

		<p>
			Caption: The left storyboard is post-based walks through a simple situation where 
			Sean loses their student ID card and uses our app to find it. Another 
			student finds his card and replies to Sean's post so they can promptly 
			retrieve it. In the right storyboard that is map-based, Alex lost their keys and cannot 
			find them. They open our app and see that someone else has posted its
			location on the map. Alex can easily go to the key's location and 
			update the status of the post, saying it was found.
		</p><br/>
		
		<h2>Needfinding</h2>
		<p>
			In order to design Find and Seek, we needed to find out what our user
			base (UCSD students) would want in a lost and found app. Originally,
			it was supposed to be released for anyone to use. However, upon 
			further thought on its implementation, we've decided to limit the 
			user base to just users within UCSD. That way, it is both easier to 
			manage and more likely to gain traction within a smaller community 
			such as a university rather than through a wide release. In addition,
			we also needed to figure out what our user base did when they lost an
			item. This would allow us to directly address any issues they had and 
			help plan what features would be useful to implement. After asking
			several UCSD students to walk me through their process, I found that 
			they mainly relied on social media to post about their item, hoping 
			that other students would notify them if it happened to be found.
			However, it was very easy for their post to get lost on facebook or 
			reddit, since other users use these platforms for a variety of
			things. Sometimes searching for their post was a hassle if it was not
			popular enough to show up. Having to post on multiple platforms also 
			made it harder to keep track of replies and slows the process of 
			finding their lost item. Thus, we needed to create a centralized app 
			that would streamline the search process so users can find their item
			more efficiently. 
		</p><br/>
		
		<h2>Competitive Audit</h2><br/>
		<img class="bigimg" src="images/competitive_analysis.png">
		<p>
			In the table above, we assessed potential competitors based on 
			features that would make a lost and found app stand out. Since it is
			free to post on social media, Facebook and Reddit seem more common 
			than other competitors, which are not free. Physical trackers such as 
			Tile and TrackR seem like a good solution, but the users in their 
			reviews often found the range to be too short or generally not worth
			the amount of money. LoFo seemed to be the most viable competitor, as
			most of its features were free, but was more focused on lost and
			found items like how we wanted our app to be. For these reasons, we 
			wanted to make a free app with a better search algorithm than other 
			platforms and rely on community efforts instead of a physical tracker.
		</p><br/>
		
		<h2>Paper Prototypes</h2>
		<p>
			Paper prototype 1 (Find my Item) focused on the location aspect of 
			finding items for users who were more space-oriented. On the home
			page, users would select the "Map" option and be taken to a real-time
			map that would show them the possible locations of items other users 
			have lost. Each pin represented an item that could be clicked on for 
			more information and the circle around it was its possible range. 
			There is a search bar at the top of the screen to make finding 
			specific items nearby easier. In order for the user to create a pin 
			for their lost item, they would have to hold down on the screen and 
			adjust the location of the pin. Then, they could add more information
			about the item and other users could see it. 
		</p>

		<p>
			Paper Prototype 2 (Finnder) had more options on the home screen for 
			a user, who could search for an item, manage their account, or browse 
			other items that were lost or found. The account page would include 
			their username, a profile picture, and lists of items they've 
			previously lost and found. Clicking on "Lost" or "Found" on the home 
			page would take the user to a scrollable list of items. If anything 
			seems interesting, they could select a certain post to see more 
			information about it, such as where it was last seen and the owner's 
			contact information. In addition, the user could make a post 
			themselves or search for the item they are looking for with a filter 
			option.

		<h2>Wireframes</h2>
		<p>
			After testing the paper prototypes, we found there were issues that
			we did not address. For example in prototype 1, we did not address 
			the need to make clear where the user was on the map. Prototype 1 
			seemed too simple and did not keep the user's attention, so we
			decided to proceed with prototype 2, which had more useful features.
			The result is the wireframe below and is a rough sketch of what our 
			app could look like. The name was changed to "Find and Seek" because 
			"Finnder" sounded too much like "Tinder" and we did not want users 
			associating the two together. Some users were confused about the 
			priority of buttons in the paper prototype, so we changed the labels
			of the buttons to make it more related to the motivations of the
			user. The buttons related to accounts were subsequently moved to the
			bottom. Moreover, we thought it would be easier for users to navigate
			through posts if we had only one page with tabs for lost and found 
			items, as opposed to two pages in the prototype.

		<h2>User Testing and Research</h2>
		<p>
			Through our tests, we noticed three general patterns in tester 
			behavior. The users valued and wanted the app to be simple, clear, 
			and flexible. These were all showcased in the issues users 
			communicated to us during the tests. Portions of the app, especially 
			when creating an account, had too many requirements which deterred
			from the experience. Features of the app, such as buttons, were at 
			times ambiguous. At other times, information seemed redundant. 
			Lastly, the lack of ability to edit posts showed that testers wanted
			more freedom. They had these patterns because we assumed that our 
			buttons and forms would be intuitive after working on our app for so
			long. However, our testing has shown that they are not and first time
			users were often confused. This led us to change where we positioned
			our buttons in the final app.

		<h2>Alternate Designs and Google Analytics</h2>
		<p>
			Users who tested Find and Seek on their phone had a difficult time
			reaching for the corner where the search button was and we wondered 
			if it was more convenient to place the search bar at the bottom. 
			That way, users would be able to search faster, which was the main 
			goal of our app. The "A" page has the search bar at the top of our
			page and is our control, while the "B" page has the search bar on the 
			bottom.

		&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
		&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 
		Page B</p>
		
		<p>
			We used an A/B Google Analytics test to see if more people would use
			the search bar if it was at the bottom. Half of the visitors would be
			randomly given page A while the other half would be given page B. 
			Regardless of which page they are given, we logged if they clicked 
			the search bar or not to see if page B was more popular. However, the
			p-value was not significant, so we decided not to change our original
			layout of the search bar.

		<p>
			From start to finish, Find and Seek was challenging to design and
			implement, but our efforts were well rewarded. Our home page changed
			from 4 buttons to 2 and reflected a user need for simplicity. 
			Throughout our iterations, we tried to make our features clear and 
			easy to use. For example, the "new post" button is large and stands 
			out at the bottom of the screen, making it intuitive for users who 
			want to make a new post. Moreover, they can use the search bar to 
			find specific items, look at what other people have posted, and view
			their account page to see what items they've lost or found before.
